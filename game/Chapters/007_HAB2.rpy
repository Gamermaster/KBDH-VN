    "Kyon fidgeted uncomfortably, watching the sparks fly between Haruhi's eyes and his mother's. He wasn't certain what would amuse him more; his mother being terrified of Haruhi, or Haruhi being terrified of his mother. The idea of it being funny faded when he realized that, ultimately, any leftover irritation would spill soundly onto his head."

    "He spared a silent prayer of thanks for the fact that his sister had been sent to her room to avoid witnessing the current confrontation, even though she would inevitably hound him with questions about it later."

    "Kanae finished her explanation, the story delivered with embarrassing shoujou- romance panache, complete with descriptions of some uber-bishonen action-hero that trailed flowing sakura petals wherever he moved, and a villainous Ryuguu Ryo that literally slobbered over the hapless damsel in distress. She even embarrassedly referenced swooning into Kyon's arms as the bishonen figure that he gathered was supposed to be him carried her to safety, when the villain was left defeated and shamed."

    "Naturally, Haruhi ate the description of these over-the-top antics up with a {i}spoon{/i}, nodding in confirmation to every point, as though she'd actually been there. Just as naturally, Kyon's mother didn't believe it for a second."

    "\"Really,\" the woman said after a moment, her cool eyes breaking from Haruhi's long enough to touch on Kanae's, then away to Kyon's, where they hardened into twin orbs of pure menace, the like he had only previously seen from Haruhi herself. Deciding it was a woman-only-power that they all accessed at various levels of maturity, he gave it up as a lost cause."

    "He could at least take consolation in the fact that he'd — somehow — manage to cow Mori into acting subservient, even if there was no way in hell he'd pull the same off with his mother, Haruhi, or probably his sister."

    "\"I also wasn't raised to look the other way when a crime was being committed,\" he said, shifting uncomfortably in his seat on the couch beneath his mother's gaze. \"Kanae-chan may have ... embellished ... a little bit, but what she said is generally true; I only did what I did to protect her.\" He'd taken off the bandage on his face shortly after leaving the school; Yuki had repaired the damage already, and he didn't know if his mother was certain of the severity of the actual combat."
    nvl clear
    "\"And you couldn't find a teacher, or someone who could deal with it? You didn't call the police?\" his mother countered. \"Yes, there is an expectation that as a good young man you'll do the {i}right{/i} thing, but you're not some television hero! You are not judge, jury, and executioner! We live in a society of rules and laws, and those are meant to be followed — aside from which, that boy had a {i}knife{/i}! What if you'd been hurt?\""

If you can't clean up your act — by which I mean 90 or better on {i}every{/i} test and assignment from this point forward, then I'm pulling you out of that trouble-making club and sending you {i}straight{/i} back to cram school!\""
