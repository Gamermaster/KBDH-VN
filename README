This is a checklist of things that need to be done. Feel free to add or remove things from it as you see fit.

First release is finished! Time to work on the second half of Chapter 5 and fix all the mistakes I (Zfish9) made on chapters 6-8 :D

Add the Kyon cheek cut to relevant scenes in chapter 6-8 and before.

Search for "blush" in chapter 6. Haruhi should blush at one point, but her sprite doesn't do it.

Remove the "Mikuru no Kokoro" tenderly romantic theme from the scene in which Kyon strangles Ryuugu. The following Tsuruya scene is sweet, but... no.
It's deeply dissonant. A few other BGMs earlier in the 6th chapter are sorta off, too.

Fix the blush in TsuruyaTemplate.png. It was cropped and damaged badly.

Design an awesome K:BDH logo.


Background images that are needed:

Other:
Cuts, bruises, bandages, and other things that can be placed on characters like Blush can. (optional?)

Readme:

How to use the code:

For starters, you need Ren'Py, the visual novel engine that's used. That's an
easy download and install; put it wherever. On your first run of Ren'Py, or
thereafter through the Options screen, it asks you to select a project
directory. Pick an empty directory somewhere, then put the directory containing
this file—probably 'KBDH-VN'—into that empty directory. After that, you should
be able to click 'Select Project' from the Ren'Py main menu and select
'KBDH-VN'.

After selecting the project, you can launch it or edit it from the Ren'Py
menu. I personally use a separate editor, but Ren'Py comes with jEdit, which is
serviceable. The specifics of the Ren'Py language are available on their web
site. Regarding music and images...that's not my department. :P They'll fit in
the repository fine, but editing them is something that the people doing it will
know better than me.

Good luck, all.
